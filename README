This project is an replace to the original notification-daemon[1]. Instead of
flashing a popup this daemon can easily changed into specific behavior. At
the moment it will forward notifications to wmii[2].


TODOS:

  * make script more generic
  * add support for possible features of specification[3]
    * Markup
    * Actions
    * Hints (category, urgency level, icon data, sound, desktop entry, ...)
    * Expiration Timeout
  * replacing existing items
  * feedback from wmii (actions, dismiss item, expire item, ...)

  Not everything of these items makes sense in context of minimalism but some
  sugar such as actions would be nice.

  IDEA1: Right click to status button will dismiss it. Left click will open
          a popup with icon data or buttons for actions.

  IDEA2: Replace complete wmii bar with notification. Show message in lbar
          and buttons in rbar.

BUGS:

  * Sometimes the daemon hangs and can only killed with a SIGKILL.

SUBMODULE:

  This Project requires the current version of ruby-dbus[4]. Only tested with
  version 0.3.0.

INSTALL:
